# Jeff Coleman’s Laws and Management Rules

My grandfather, Jeff Coleman, started Coleman Research back in the 1980s, it was eventually sold to [L3 Communications](http://www.coleman-aerospace.com/about.htm) in the mid-90s.  As part of his legacy, he wrote a list of laws and management rules on how to run a successful business.  My father, Michael Coleman, took these rules and started Coleman Technologies, Inc. a company focused primarily on networking and VoIP.  They also had some other interesting products like their GPS tracking units for the police to use on suspects.  CTI eventually becaome part of [Presidio](https://www.presidio.com), a much larger VoIP and networking provider.

I think they serve as an excellent compass.  Seeing as these rules have provided a successful heading in these two business, I look to them for guidance as well.

17. The only people that are not making mistakes are those that are not doing anything.
18. Don’t bite off more than you can bite off.
19. The most important and most difficult trait to identify is the ability to get things done.
20. A manager with a full calendar every day isn’t delegating properly.
21. A full day spent in meetings is 40% wasted.
22. A pat on the back is the ultimate in cost effectiveness.
23. A manager that takes the credit for the work of the troops should be made a member of the troops.
24. A manager unwilling to take risks is destined for mediocrity.
25. Twenty percent of the people do eighty percent of the work.
26. People that feel comfortable in their job are more productive.
27. All contracts end.
28. The prepared bird gets the worm.
