# Practical Large Language Models (LLMs)

In today's job market, employers often use algorithms and artificial intelligence to sift through resumes and select candidates. This means that even if you have the right skills and experience for a job, your resume might never make it past the initial screening process if it's not formatted or worded correctly. This is where using artificial intelligence to update your resume can be incredibly helpful. By leveraging the power of machine learning algorithms like ChatGPT, you can ensure that your resume meets the requirements of both human recruiters and automated systems.

ChatGPT is a language model developed by OpenAI that can analyze your resume and provide suggestions for improvement. It uses natural language processing to understand the content and structure of your resume, and then provides feedback on everything from formatting to wording. This can be incredibly helpful if you're struggling to articulate your skills and experience in a way that resonates with recruiters or if you're not sure what keywords or phrases to include to ensure that your resume makes it past automated screening tools. However, it's important to note that while ChatGPT can help you optimize your resume for success, it's still important to be honest about your skills and experience. Exaggerating or lying on your resume can damage your reputation and ultimately hurt your chances of landing and retaining a job.

## The problem with traditional resume editing

Editing a resume is a daunting task for many job seekers. It often requires you to reflect on your professional experiences, identify your strengths, and determine how best present yourself to potential employers. This can be a vulnerable process, as you may seek feedback from friends and family who may not have the expertise or objectivity to provide constructive criticism. Additionally, resume preferences can be subjective and culturally specific. For example, in some cultures, it is customary to include a photo and date of birth on your resume, while in others cultures, it is strictly forbidden. These cultural differences can create biases and misunderstandings in the hiring process, further complicating the process of updating your resume.

Despite these challenges, there are objective strategies for optimizing a resume. Using data-driven feedback, such as analyzing job postings and industry trends, can help you identify key skills and experiences that are in demand. Additionally, leveraging tools like ChatGPT can provide an objective assessment of your resume's effectiveness and help you identify areas for improvement. By focusing on objective measures and seeking out expert feedback, you can ensure that your resume is both culturally appropriate and optimized for success in the job market.

## Improving work history
 
When updating your resume, it's essential to ensure that your work history experiences match the job posting. Employers are looking for candidates who have the relevant skills and experiences necessary to perform the job successfully. Therefore, tailoring your resume to highlight the experiences and achievements fthat align with the job requirements can increase your chances of being selected for an interview. It's also important to use language and industry-specific keywords that are relevant to the job posting. By doing so, you can demonstrate your familiarity with the job and the industry, making you a more attractive candidate to potential employers. Overall, taking the time to carefully align your work history experiences with the job posting can make a significant difference in your chances of landing your desired position.

> 1. Based on the job posting, it would be helpful to add any experience related to dental assisting, such as assisting with dental procedures, taking dental radiographs, and maintaining patient files. Any relevant training or certification in CPR/AED (BLS) should also be added.
> 
> 2. It may not be necessary to include information about managing inventory for the office front desk unless it directly relates to dental supplies and equipment. Similarly, fielding phone calls and setting up appointments may not be as relevant to the dental assistant position, unless it involves scheduling dental appointments or communicating with dental patients.
> 
> 3. The work history could be updated to provide more specific details and metrics about patient intake and relationship-building with supply vendors. For example, instead of saying "over 500 patients so far," it could be more impactful to say something like "successfully managed patient intake for 500+ patients, ensuring accurate and timely record-keeping and facilitating smooth transitions between appointments." Similarly, instead of simply stating "developing relationships between supply vendors and office staff," more information could be added about the specific vendors and the benefits of those relationships, such as cost savings or improved supply chain efficiency.

# Matching skills with job posting

It's crucial to ensure that your skills match the requirements listed in the job posting when updating your resume. However, it's essential to keep in mind that recruiters may not be familiar with all the job domain synonyms for skills. For example, a job posting may ask for "Java" but a candidate's resume might only mention "Spring framework." While the Spring framework is a popular Java-based application framework, some recruiters may not recognize it as a relevant skill. Therefore, it's crucial to match your skills with the skills listed in the job posting. By doing so, you can ensure that recruiters understand your qualifications and increase your chances of being selected for an interview.

## Cover letter generation

Instruction trained LLMs can also be used to generate a customized

Matching your cover letter to a job posting can greatly increase your chances of being selected for an interview. To do so, start by carefully reading the job posting to understand the skills, experiences, and qualities that the employer is looking for. Then, use that information to tailor your cover letter to highlight your relevant qualifications and explain why you're the ideal candidate for the position. It's essential to use language and industry-specific keywords that align with the job posting to demonstrate your familiarity with the role and the industry. Additionally, you should explain how your skills and experiences align with the job requirements and provide specific examples of your achievements in related roles. By crafting a customized cover letter that speaks directly to the employer's needs and demonstrates your value, you can increase your chances of landing the job.

## Gotchas - Biases
As a job seeker, it is important to check for biases in a resume and cover letter that GPT may have added. While GPT is an impressive language model, it is not immune to the biases and prejudices that exist in our society. As a result, the language generated by GPT may inadvertently include stereotypes or discriminatory language that could negatively impact your job search. By reviewing your resume and cover letter with a critical eye, you can ensure that you accurately represent your qualifications and experiences without perpetuating any biases. It is crucial to present yourself in a way that is inclusive and welcoming to potential employers, and this requires careful scrutiny of the language used in my job application materials.

## Gotchas - Hallucinations
You also must check for hallucinations the GPT model may introduce. The model may confuse a job posting requirement with a fact in your work history. If an employer asked you about a skill or attribute of your resume that you actually do not have experience in, saying "oops, ChatGPT must have accidentally added that" is not an acceptable answer.
