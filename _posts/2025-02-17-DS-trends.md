# Upwinds for DS Jobs

## Engineers can use AutoML to create models

I was discussing with my friend Gregory Azualos at Google, what it takes to train an ML model at Google. Google has double downed on automating ML training, beyond just building data pipelines that feed into ML-training batches and code deployments. They are fully invested in AutoML infra, where engineers, with no ML or DS knowledge can train a classifier against a host of mediums of different sizes, removing the need for specialized DS people to tune the model.

He admitted the AutoML models might not be as efficient from a power or latency perspective, but true cost of creating ML models, was creating the model, not inference costs. Going forward, companies will continue to invest in reducing inference costs automatically (see DeepSeek-R1), but the number of jobs required to do this are relatively small.

## AI can replace customized models

If performance and cost isn't super critical, engineers can just use an GPT-based model to perform their classification. Before ChatGPT, custom classifiers must be trained and retrained as the business / regulations change. But since ChatGPT can do everything and is ready to do everything, there is no need to spend weeks or months trying to design and train a custom model for each business cases.

Instead of a team of DS people outputting 1-2 models per month, 1 engineer can modify a prompt to chatgpt in days and now there is a now classification ready for production.

Once the AI has classified enough production data and inference costs (either dollar or latency) exceed budget, a custom model can easily be trained using automl by an engineer.

[0] - Some people use the term "cheaper", but I don't think the talent should be considered cheap, b/c that has negative connotations of lower quality.
