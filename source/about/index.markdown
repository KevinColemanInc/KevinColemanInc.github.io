## Who am I?
Based in San Francisco, CA, I am a jack of all trades software engineer that specializes in web applications and mobile apps.  I graduated from Georgia Tech with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering.

## Are you avaliable for consulting?
Sort of.  I am mostly focusing on my own projects, but I do take on consulting projects.  I charge weekly and your bugdet should be at least in the low five figures.  My favorite topics to consult on are ruby on rails and android engineering.
