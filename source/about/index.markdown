## Who am I?
I am Kevin Coleman.  Based in Atlanta, Ga, I am a jack of all trades software developer that specializes in web applications.  I graduated from Georgia Tech with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering.  

## Are you avaliable for consulting?
Sort of.  I am mostly focusing on my own projects, but I do take on consulting projects.  I charge weekly and your budet should be at least in the low five figures.  My favorite topics to consult on are ruby on rails development and android development.
