Escaping slashes in can leave regex expressions difficult to read.  A regex statement that is meant to identify a url like this one `http://atdc.org/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`.

would look something like this using the standard `/expression/` notation:

```
/http:\/\/atdc.org\/wp-admin\/admin-ajax.php/
```

But if you use the `%r{expression}` notation, then your regex expressions do not need to be muddled with escaping slashes:

```
%r{http://atdc.org/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php}
```

Much easier to read :)
