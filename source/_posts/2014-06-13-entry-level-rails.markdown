I get asked a lot about what it takes to break into the Ruby on Rails industry at the various hackathons and start up weekends I have attended.  Spurred by this [/r/ruby question](http://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/282n9k/what_ruby_skills_are_essential_for_an_entrylevel/).  I shall try my best to answer this question in a public setting.

## I want to this in an entry level rails developer
1. Build a [CRUDL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) application
1. Understand and apply [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
1. Build a to-do application or any simple super basic app that requires a few controllers, models, etc.
1. Use slightly obscure gems, like the [twitter](https://github.com/sferik/twitter), [koala](https://github.com/arsduo/koala), [mandrill](https://rubygems.org/gems/mandrill-api), [kaminari](https://github.com/amatsuda/kaminari), [jbuilder](https://github.com/rails/jbuilder), etc. to prove to me that they can read the documentation and figure out how to use a gem.

## Bonuses
1. Understanding a testing framework ([rspec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails) is my preference)
1. Knowing some basic javascript (jquery)
1. Know [TDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)
1. Knowing Thin Controllers, Fat Models
1. Attends the local ruby on rails [meetup](http://meetup.com)
