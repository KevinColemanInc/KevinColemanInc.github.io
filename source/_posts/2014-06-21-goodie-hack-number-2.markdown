[Goodie Hack](http://goodiehack.com/) was awesome! I met some really cool people and got to learn more about the Atlanta Food and Farming organizations.

I joined the Atlanta Food and Farming organization where we integerated [Google Map Builder](https://www.google.com/maps/preview) and [Google Forms](http://www.google.com/google-d-s/createforms.html) to build an awesome resource for sharing data about where your food comes from.  Food related organizations submit data about what they are doing to encourage healthy eating in the community.  Our map includes information like where the closet community garden is or where they can donate their compost.

[Yosep Kim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yosepk) built [AsItGoes.com](htttp://asitgoes.com) to help presenters get feed back on the presentation. Apparently, I need to be more funny, ha.  I am going to take this tool to my [Toastmaster](http://www.toastmasters.org/)'s club and use it for feedback for my presentations.

I can't wait to attend to the next event.
