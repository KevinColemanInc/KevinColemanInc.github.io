- The dropdown should allow selecting multiple items from a list of ~200 options.
- Must support:
  - Typing to filter/search options.
  - Keyboard navigation (Up/Down to move, Enter/Space to select, Esc to close).
  - Clicking to open/close the menu.
  - “Select all” and “Clear all” actions.
- Selected items should appear as removable tags/chips above the dropdown (each with an “x” icon to remove).
- The component should be easy to integrate:
  - Accept `options: { id: string | number; label: string }[]` as a prop.
  - Accept `value: (string | number)[]` for selected IDs.
  - Accept `onChange: (selectedIds: (string | number)[]) => void` to notify parent when selection changes.
- Make sure it’s efficient with ~200 items:
  - Avoid unnecessary re-renders.
  - Use memoization where it makes sense.
- Include:
  - A short example of how to use this component in a parent component, including how to pass a list of about 200 items.
  - Basic styling so it looks clean and usable out of the box (no UI library required).
- Add clear comments explaining:
  - How to add new items to the list.
  - How to remove items from the list.
  - How to hook this into a form or state management.
