## Who am I?
Ruby on Rails developer at Spark Start.

## Are you avaliable for consulting?
Sort of.  I am mostly focusing on my own projects, but I do take on consulting projects.  I charge weekly and your bugdet should be at least in the low five figures.  My favorite topics to consult on are ruby on rails and android engineering.
